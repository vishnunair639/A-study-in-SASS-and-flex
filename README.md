## SCSS concepts
- variables (Implemented in the demo)
- Nesting (Implemented in the demo)
- Nested rules using & (Implemented in the demo ==> check .btn class)
- Mixins ( they are like functions in JS and can accept parameters==> @mixin mixinName {})
   - They can used by using @include mixinName()
- Partials to move seperate styles of components ==> names like _partialName.scss.(Implemented in the demo)
   - They can be imported using @import "path to the partial.scss"
